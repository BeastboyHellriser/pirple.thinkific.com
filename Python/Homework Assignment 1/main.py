# Lyrics for the song
Lyrics =  r'''
Today, upon a bus I saw a girl with golden hair,
And in my heart I wished that I was just as fair
When suddenly she rose to leave, I saw her hobble down the aisle.
She had one leg and wore a crutch, but as she passed, a smile.
Oh Allah Oh Allah , forgive me when I whine.
I have 2 legs to walk upon and the world is mine.

I stopped to buy some candy; i met a boy who had such charm.
We talked he seemed so happy, if I were late, it'd do no harm.
And as I left, he said to me, "Thank you, you've been so kind.
It's nice to talk with folks like you. You see," he said, "I'm blind."
Oh Allah Oh Allah , forgive me when I whine.
I have 2 eyes to see the world and the world is mine.
